I'm Lam Nguyen, an MS student from the Department of Computer Science and Data Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I received a B.S in Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University in 2024.

I am generally interested in reasoning about human intention and behavior given arbitrary task spaces for the purposes of continuous human robot interaction. Currently exploring reasoning and interaction for manipulators. Previously, I worked on human intention modeling and prediction for continuous human-in-the-loop control of aerial and ground robots and agile safe navigation in unknown and unstructured environments.
My areas of focus are robot system design, navigation, task representation, human robot interaction.

You can contact me at ltn18 at case dot edu.
