​I am a Ph.D. student in the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Prof. Nathan Michael at the [Resilient Intelligent Systems Lab (RISLab)](https://www.rislab.org/). Previously, I collaborated with Prof. N. Michael and Prof. Koushil Sreenath (Hybrid Robotics Lab) on efficient operator intent and adaptation algorithms for teleoperating mobile vehicles. I obtained my B.A.Sc. in [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/about_engsci/) with Honours from University of Toronto, with a major in [Aerospace Engineering](http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/) and a minor in Robotics and Mechatronics.

My research interests include applying statistical learning techniques to control theory. More recently, my research has focused on online estimation of user intent for control of autonomous mobile robots, and agile safe navigation in cluttered environments.
