Give this problem a try [3439. Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time I](https://leetcode.com/problems/reschedule-meetings-for-maximum-free-time-i/description/).

---

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer eventTime denoting the duration of an event, where the event occurs from time `t = 0` to time `t = eventTime`.

You are also given two integer arrays startTime and endTime, each of length n. These represent the start and end time of n **non-overlapping** meetings, where the ith meeting occurs during the time `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`.

You can reschedule **at most** `k` meetings by moving their start time while maintaining the **same duration**, to **maximize** the **longest** continuous period of free time during the event.

The **relative** order of all the meetings should stay the same and they should remain non-overlapping.

Return the **maximum** amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

**Note** that the meetings can **not** be rescheduled to a time outside the event.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** 
  `eventTime = 5, k = 1, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5]`

- **Output:** 
  `2`

- **Explanation:**
  Reschedule the meeting at `[1, 2]` to `[2, 3]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[0, 2]`.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** 
  `eventTime = 10, k = 1, startTime = [0,2,9], endTime = [1,4,10]`

- **Output:** 
  `6`

- **Explanation:**
  Reschedule the meeting at `[2, 4]` to `[1, 3]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[3, 9]`.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** 
  `eventTime = 5, k = 2, startTime = [0,1,2,3,4], endTime = [1,2,3,4,5]`

- **Output:** 
  `0`

- **Explanation:**
  There is no time during the event not occupied by meetings.

#### Constraints

- `1 <= eventTime <= 1e9`
- `n == startTime.length == endTime.length`
- `2 <= n <= 1e5`
- `0 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= eventTime`
- `endTime[i] <= startTime[i + 1]` where `i` lies in the range `[0, n - 2]`

### Example Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, int k, int[] startTime, int[] endTime) {
        // [0, eventTime]
        // n = 10^5

        int n = startTime.length;

        int[][] events = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) events[i] = new int[] {startTime[i], endTime[i]};
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]); // non-overlapping

        int[] spaces = new int[n+1];
        spaces[0] = events[0][0] - 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            spaces[i] = events[i][0] - events[i-1][1];
        }
        spaces[n] = eventTime - events[n-1][1];
        
        // n events, n+1 spaces
        // perform maximum subarray of length k+1

        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k+1; i++) sum += spaces[i];

        int answer = sum;
        for (int i = k+1; i < n+1; i++) {
            answer = Math.max(answer, sum);
            sum += spaces[i];
            sum -= spaces[i-(k+1)];
        }
        answer = Math.max(answer, sum);

        return answer;
    }
}
```

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
