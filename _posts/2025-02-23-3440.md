Give this problem a try [3440. Reschedule Meetings for Maximum Free Time II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reschedule-meetings-for-maximum-free-time-ii/).

---

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `eventTime` denoting the duration of an event. You are also given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime`, each of length `n`.

These represent the start and end times of `n` **non-overlapping** meetings that occur during the event between time `t = 0` and time `t = eventTime`, where the `ith` meeting occurs during the time `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`.

You can reschedule **at most** one meeting by moving its start time while maintaining the **same duration**, such that the meetings remain non-overlapping, to **maximize** the **longest** continuous period of free time during the event.

Return the **maximum** amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

**Note** that the meetings can **not** be rescheduled to a time outside the event and they should remain non-overlapping.

**Note:** In this version, it is **valid** for the relative ordering of the meetings to change after rescheduling one meeting.

**Example 1:**

- **Input:** 
  `eventTime = 5, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5]`

- **Output:** 
  `2`

- **Explanation:**
  Reschedule the meeting at `[1, 2]` to `[2, 3]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[0, 2]`.

**Example 2:**

- **Input:** 
  `eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,7,9], endTime = [1,8,10]`

- **Output:** 
  `7`

- **Explanation:**
  Reschedule the meeting at `[0, 1]` to `[8, 9]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[0, 7]`.

**Example 3:**

- **Input:** 
  `eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,3,7,9], endTime = [1,4,8,10]`

- **Output:** 
  `6`

- **Explanation:**
  Reschedule the meeting at `[3, 4]` to `[8, 9]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[1, 7]`.

**Example 4:**

- **Input:** 
  `eventTime = 5, startTime = [0,1,2,3,4], endTime = [1,2,3,4,5]`

- **Output:** 
  `0`

- **Explanation:**
  There is no time during the event not occupied by meetings.

#### Constraints
- `1 <= eventTime <= 1e9`
- `n == startTime.length == endTime.length`
- `2 <= n <= 1e5`
- `0 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= eventTime`
- `endTime[i] <= startTime[i + 1]` where `i` lies in the range `[0, n - 2]`.

### Example Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, int[] startTime, int[] endTime) {
        int n = startTime.length;

        int[][] events = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) events[i] = new int[] {startTime[i], endTime[i]};

        int[] spaces = new int[n+1];
        spaces[0] = events[0][0] - 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            spaces[i] = events[i][0] - events[i-1][1];
        }
        spaces[n] = eventTime - events[n-1][1];

        int maxSpace = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n+1; i++) maxSpace = Math.max(maxSpace, spaces[i]);

        // maxPref = max prefix previous space 0 -> i
        // maxSuff = max suffix previous space i -> n-1

        // check maxPref[i-2] and maxSuff[i+2]
        int[] maxPref = new int[n];
        int[] maxSuff = new int[n];

        // maxPref[i] = prefix max spaces 0 -> i event
        maxPref[0] = spaces[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) maxPref[i] = Math.max(maxPref[i-1], spaces[i]);

        // maxSuff[i] = suffic max spaces i -> n-1 event
        maxSuff[n-1] = spaces[n];
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) maxSuff[i] = Math.max(maxSuff[i+1], spaces[i+1]);

        int answer = maxSpace;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int prev = spaces[i];
            int next = spaces[i+1];
            int eventSpace = events[i][1] - events[i][0];

            // consider 0 and n-1 independently
            // event[0] can only be moved to maxSuff[1]
            // event[n-1] can only be moved to maxPref[n-2]

            if (i == 0) {
                int maxSuffSpace = maxSuff[1];
                if (eventSpace > maxSuffSpace) {
                    answer = Math.max(answer, prev + next);
                }
                else {
                    answer = Math.max(answer, prev + next + eventSpace);
                }
                continue;
            }

            if (i == n-1) {
                int maxPrefSpace = maxPref[n-2];
                if (eventSpace > maxPrefSpace) {
                    answer = Math.max(answer, prev + next);
                }
                else {
                    answer = Math.max(answer, prev + next + eventSpace);
                }
                continue;
            }

            // consider maxPref[i-1] and maxSuff[i+1]
            int maxPrefSpace = maxPref[i-1];
            int maxSuffSpace = maxSuff[i+1];

            if (eventSpace > maxPrefSpace && eventSpace > maxSuffSpace) {
                // can only slide within bound
                answer = Math.max(answer, prev + next);
            }
            else {
                // can allocate eventSpace to some other space
                answer = Math.max(answer, prev + next + eventSpace);
            }
        }

        return answer;
    }

### Sign-off

Congratulations on making it this far! Although LeetCode rates this as a **medium** question, I actually consider it **medium-hard** because it requires a smart mix of basic techniques and sharp observation to reduce to O(N) complexity. Best of luck in your future competitions!
